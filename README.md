# ai_2023
Repo for the workshops of the AI Course for 2023-1

# Projects
The repo is structured in such a way that every folder of the main directory contains an specific workshop or main project. Each workshop required specific tasks with specific algorithms that are stored as subfolders.

# 1. Supervised
This directory contains the first workshop, where a custom multi-layer perceptron (MLP) was developed from scratch. Temporal data with 2 inputs and 1 output was considered to investigate the relationship between neural network architecture and the progress of training and learning in a regression task.

# 2. Hybrid supervised
This directory contains the second workshop, where we focused on the implementation of autoencoders, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and generative adversarial networks (GAN).

# 3. Unsupervised
This directory currently contains the matrix norms to be used in classification algorithms such as: mountain, substractive, k-means and fuzzy c-means.
