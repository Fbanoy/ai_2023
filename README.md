# ai_2023
Repo for the workshops of the AI Course for 2023-1

# Projects
The repo is structured in such a way that every folder of the main directory contains an specific workshop or main project. Each workshop required specific tasks with specific algorithms that are stored as subfolders.

# 1. Supervised
This directory contains the first workshop, where a custom multi-layer perceptron (MLP) was developed from scratch. Temporal data with 2 inputs and 1 output was considered to investigate the relationship between neural network architecture and the progress of training and learning in a regression task.

# 2. Hybrid supervised
This directory contains the second workshop, where we focused on the implementation of autoencoders, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and generative adversarial networks (GAN).

## GAN
Contains a pre-trained convolutional neural network that was adapted to take an arbitrary video with and arbitrary reference style image, and retrains the network to transfer the style of the reference image to the input video. The characteristics of the original video are preserved in the output, such as: audio, frames per second (fps) and frame size (length,width).

# 3. matrix_norms
Contains a few of the most common norms for matrices.
